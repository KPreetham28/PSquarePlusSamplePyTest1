Python relational operators
Operator	Name						Example
==			Equal						x == y	
!=			Not equal					x != y	
>			Greater than				x > y	
<			Less than					x < y

'''
Python logical operators
Operator	Description														Example
and 		Returns True if both statements are true						x < 5 and  x < 10	
or			Returns True if one of the statements is true					x < 5 or x < 4	
not			Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true			not(x < 5 and x < 10)
'''

'''
Python Identity operators
Operator	Description													Example
is 			Returns True if both variables are the same object			x is y	
is not		Returns True if both variables are not the same object		x is not y
'''

'''
Python Membership operators
Operator	Description		
in 			Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object	
Example: x in y	
not in		Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object	
Example: x not in y
'''

'''
Operator	Name					Description															
& 			AND						Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1	
Example: x & y	
|			OR						Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1	
Example: x | y	
^			XOR						Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1	
Example: x ^ y	
~			NOT						Inverts all the bits			
Example: ~x	
<<   		Zero fill left shift	Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off	
Example: x << 2	
>>			Signed right shift		Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, 
									and let the rightmost bits fall off	
Example: x >> 2
